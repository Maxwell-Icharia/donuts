# donuts
Returns the number of donuts as 'Number of donuts: x'
       
       If the number of donuts is less than 10 then x is equal to the number of the donuts
       whereas if it is 10 or more than 10, x is equal to 'many'.

# for example: 

    when the fuction is called-donuts(5)-it returns 'Number of donuts: 5'
    and donuts(23) returns 'Number of donuts: many'

The fuction is compatible with python 2.7
